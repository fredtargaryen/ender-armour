    Ender Armour was going to be craftable from the mobs in my abandoned mod, Enderhounds. You can find it as a rare drop in dungeon chests.
    When Ender Armour is hit, the wearer will teleport behind the attacker in just the right spot for an immediate counterattack.
    Heh... nothin' personnel.
